## Computing optimal solutions for Salop's Circle-based model.  

This repository has the Python code I wrote for the final project / paper of ECON 28000: Industrial Organization at the University of Chicago.  
Our team's project is about finding optimal strategies for hypothetical scenario of Blue Bottle's entry to South Korean coffee market. Our analysis was based on Salop's Circle, and optimal solutions were numerically computed using the code here.  

For further context of the project, please refer to the included PDF file (presentation on our project.)  

I received final grade of A in this class.
